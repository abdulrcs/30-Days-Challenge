# 30 Days Challenge
I made this in December 29 2019 as a CS50x Final Project, which is almost new year, so when new year is around, people going to make a new year resolution right, create **good habits** and leave **bad habits** to make our life better, so I made a habit tracker called **30 Days Challenge** to track our habits within a timeframe of 30 days, and **check the box** everytime you've completed those habits, *and trust me, it's really satisfying*.
